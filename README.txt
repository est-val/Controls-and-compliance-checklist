This project involves evaluating a (fictional) company's current security posture and controls, and perform a controls
and compliance checklist to assess for controls that need to be put in place to improve the company's security and data
management, as well as organizing the controls from the most important that needs to be implemented to the least.

See 'Botium Toys Scope, goals, and risk assessment report' to see the initial company report.
See 'Controls and compliance checklist' to see my suggested controls and their order.
