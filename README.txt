This project involves evaluating a (fictional) company's current security posture and controls, and with that, perform a controls
and compliance checklist to assess for controls that need implemented to improve the company's security and data
management, as well as ranking the controls from the most critical control to the least critical control that needs to be added.

*See 'Botium Toys Scope, goals, and risk assessment report' to see the initial company report.
*See 'Controls and compliance checklist' to see my suggested controls and their order.
